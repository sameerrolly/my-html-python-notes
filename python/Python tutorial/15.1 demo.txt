demo files in python
steps in file I/O in python:
1.open()
2.read/write()
3.close()

Breif:
1. open() and read():

variable =open("fileName")  #by DEFAULT Mode is r(read) in the open    #1.Open
f=open("demo.txt")
print(f.read())                #Read also have types read(10),readline() i.e: [print(f.readlines())]
f.close()

2.Write(): Note always write in new file other wise it will update the current file and you will loose your data

f=open("demo.txt","w") 
print(f.write("Message you want to print in files"))
f.close()
